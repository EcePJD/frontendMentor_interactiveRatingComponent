## My process
FIrst, I properly organized the index.html contents to fit my envisioned html organization that is advantageous to the CSS approach I used after. As usual, I used flexBox CSS to easily organized the elements. Next, I added a false return callback to the onsubmit event of the form to prevent refresh / reload of the page. I attached the main function ( handles the verification of the date entered and the computation of the age ) as a callback in my submit button. After, is a basic javascript DOM manipulation and its done. I also added fade animation for both the container.
